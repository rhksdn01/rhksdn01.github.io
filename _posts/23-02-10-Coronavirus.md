# My Research Area 

Let's me explain my research area



## Coronavirus 
Coronaviruses have had a major impact on mankind since the mid-1960s. They are classified into four distinct genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. Both alpha and betacoronaviruses are known to cause diseases in humans.

### Betacorinavirus

####  SARS-CoV-1 & SARS-CoV-2 ; Clade B
<br/>

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus(SARS-CoV) is a species belonging to the genus beta coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae under Nidovirales (order). There are some species. The representitive species is SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2(so called **COVID-19** ). <br/>

####  MERS-CoV; Clade C
<br/>

Midlle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a species belonging to the genus beta coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae under Nidovirales (order). It has the largest genome size among RNA viruses with about 30Kb length and has positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome.

#### OC43-CoV; Clade A

### Alphacoronavirus

---

<br/>

alphacoronaviruses have received relatively little attention due to their low fatality rate (Vassilara et al., 2018). Two types of alphacoronaviruses infect humans: HCoV-229E, which was first described in the mid-1960s, and HCoV-NL63, which was identified in 2004. These two types of alphacoronaviruses are known to cause 30% of common colds in humans (Su et al., 2016).
