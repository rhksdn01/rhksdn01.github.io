## Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV)

Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) is one of the “Disease X” reported by WHO and causes an acute viral hemorrhagic fever. Rift Valley Fever (RVF) which is common zoonotic disease and is mainly transmitted through mosquitoes.

Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) is one of the “Disease X” reported by WHO and causes an acute viral hemorrhagic fever. Rift Valley Fever (RVF) which is common zoonotic disease and is mainly transmitted through mosquitoes. In this study, we aimed to develop a whole genome sequencing protocol of RVFV for diagnostic purpose. To amplify the genome, 8 pairs of primers stretched over the three genome segments (segment L of 6kb, M of 4kb, and S of 1.6kb) were designed. The primers were applied to three RNAs of RVFV strains (Lunyo, ZH548, Kenya 56, and BIME 01) and produced amplicons of expected size (0.8 - 1.6kb). The amplicons were purified and sequenced using MinION, iSeq, and Sanger sequencer. The resultant sequencing reads were successfully assembled into complete genome regardless of the sequencing platform. The limit of detection of this amplicon-based sequencing was >100 copies/μl implying that the whole genome sequence of RVFV could be directly obtained from clinical samples. Accordingly, The universal primer sets and experimental procedure would contribute to diagnosis of mutant virus of global health threatening RVFV.
